# Famuse – Hackaton Project 

//Project Description

This project took part in our last days at <Academia de Código> #75 Bootcamp @ Lisboa. 
We were challenged to create something (a game, a single page application, a web app or a mobile app) inspired by a song from António Variações. Our song was “Canção do Engate”.  
We could use any technology learned during the 14 weeks of the bootcamp or whatever else we were interested in. There were no limits. The only rules were: we had 24 hours to deliver the project (develop the project and prepare a presentation of it) and we had to work as a team using the Scrum methodology.

// The Idea

In the 1980s, in Portugal, sex was still a taboo and it was the group's general consensus that the song was a paean to purely sexual love, with such promiscuous lyrics, unthinkable for the time. 
We took this general idea we had for the song and after a brainstorm we decided to go ahead with a single page application. This app would be responsible for displaying various music albums with an associated genre. By choosing a genre, a playlist would be generated and for each of the songs a sexual position would be suggested. 
We ended up adding the functionality to choose what kind of images you would like to see suggested (whether for a homosexual or a straight couple). We also added a “go back to genre” button in the music play area that still needs some work. 

//Development 

With the Scrum methodology in mind, we used a bord to define the product backlog (product features in a list: API for music, music with auto playing, music genres, pictures…), in working features, in test and what was done. We started by separating our group into pairs and each one stayed with a feature to work on. Every two hours we did a sprint to talk about the progress and figure out what changes we should make.
